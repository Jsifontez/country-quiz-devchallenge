## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jsifontez/country-quiz-devchallenge/blob/main/public/country-quiz.gif)

Hi, :wave: this was a challenge proposed on the page [devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io), the challenge was to create a minigame with the [REST countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).

At first I thought: how am I going to start this? Then I began to divide everything into small problems that would help me complete the goal. Performing step by step until completing the challenge.

- Improved my knowledge about `React`
- Improved the use of the `useEffect` hook to make API calls
- Learned to use basic [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) animations
